# Learn@Home

---

Learn@Home is an association that connects children with learning difficulties with volunteer tutors.
The objective is to allow any student, wherever they are, to have access to remote support.
Until then, WhatsApp and SMS were mainly used. This is why Learn@Home wants to allow its students and volunteers to communicate more easily, directly from its website.
First step: the scoping phase, to define the needs and the objective to be achieved.
Project 10 of the OpenClassrooms [JavaScript React Developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) training program.
